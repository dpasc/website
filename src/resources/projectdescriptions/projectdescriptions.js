The project uses a Model, View Controller architecture to create and deliver views to the client.</p><p> The data layer is built using Entity Framework Core and the repository design pattern; the combination of the two means that the data layer can adapt to use different data sources with ease when needed.</p><p> The server side portion of the platform also has a REST API; this was made so that in future mobile applications could easily be added if needed.</p><h3>Database</h3><p> This platform uses a Microsoft SQL relational database to store user information, sale items and purchases. The application also uses a stored procedure that works in conjunction with Entity Framework to retrieve search queries from the database. The benefit to this is, we allow the database to compute the search result and return only what is required.</p><hr/><h2>Deployment</h2><p> The program is set up to run on a single server, this seemed like a simple solution for a basic project. I recently began playing around with AWS services and put together a network diagram of how the platform could potentially operate using cloud services. This would mean slight changes to the architecture of the program.</p><hr/><h2>Project Status</h2><p> The project is fully functional however, has some minor bugs. GT was a personal project that was put together for learning purposes. I will continue to work on this in my free time however, it is not of high importance. GT is also open for anyone to add to, I would like to other junior developers using to GT to experiment to learn.</p><hr/><h2>Source code</h2><p> <a href='https://github.com/dpasc/GT'>https://github.com/dpasc/GT</a></p><hr/><h2>How to run program</h2><p> Ensure you have the .NET Core run time and Microsoft SQL installed on your machine.</p><p> <b> 1.
